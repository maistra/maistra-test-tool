A testing tool for running Maistra Service Mesh tasks on an OpenShift 4.x cluster.

## Introduction

This project aims to automate Maistra Service Mesh tasks on an OpenShift 4.x Cluster.

The testing tasks are based on [istio.io Doc Tasks](https://istio.io/v1.9/docs/tasks/)

## Versions

| Name      | Version       |
| --        | --            |
| OS        | Linux         |
| Golang    | 1.13+         |
| OpenSSl   | 1.1.1+        |
| oc client | 4.x           |

## Prerequisites

Before you run the tests in this repository, you must ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. The OpenShift CLI tool `oc` is installed. You can download it from [mirror openshift-v4 clients](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/). Extract the `openshift-client-...tar.gz` file and ensure that the parent directory of `oc` and `kubectl` is part of your `PATH` environment variable.

2. You must be logged into the cluster. You can log in using the command `oc login -u [user] -p [token] --server=[OCP API server]`

3. RedHat Service Mesh Operator is installed in the cluster.

4. The `gotestsum` package is installed on the machine used to run the test suite:
    ```console
    go install gotest.tools/gotestsum@latest
    ```
5. The [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) package manager is installed on the machine used to run the test suite:


## How to run tests

To run the tests, you can either use `make test` or run the `./scripts/runtests.sh` script directly. 
Both approaches are equivalent, since `make test` simply runs the `runtests.sh` script. 
Both support running a single test, a group of tests, or the entire suite. 
For information about the test results, refer to section [Test Results](#Test results).

### Running all tests

To run all the test cases against all the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` versions supported by the current version of the OSSM operator, run the following command:
```console
make test
```

This command runs the entire test suite against the minimum supported `ServiceMeshControlPlane` version, then for the next, and so on.

#### Running against a specific Operator version

By default, maistra-test-tool assumes that the OSSM Operator version is `2.5.0` and runs tests against the `v2.3`, `v2.4`, and `v2.5` version of the ServiceMeshControlPlane.
To run against the '2.4.x' version of the Operator, run the tests with the `OPERATOR_VERSION` environment variable set to `2.4.x`. For example, for Operator version `2.4.2`, run the tests as follows:

```console
OPERATOR_VERSION=2.4.2 make test
```

### Running a group of tests

To run all the test cases in a specific test group against all the supported `ServiceMeshControlPlane` versions, specify the test group name in the `TEST_GROUP` environment variable.

For example, to run the tests in the `smoke` group, run the following command:
```console
TEST_GROUP=smoke make test
```

Take in count that when you set `disconnected` as `TEST_GROUP`, the test will need to pass also the bastion host using this variable: `BASTION_HOST`, if you don't set it, the test will fail because the repleace of the image will fail.

See [pkg/util/test/test.go](pkg/util/test/test.go#L13-L18) for a list of available test groups.

### Running a single test case

To run a single test case against all the supported `ServiceMeshControlPlane` versions, specify the name of the test function after `make test <name>`.

For example, to run the `TestFaultInjection` test case, run the following command:
```console
make test TestFaultInjection
```

Alternatively, you can run a specific test case by specifying the name in the `TEST_CASE` environment.

For example, to run the `TestFaultInjection` test case, run the following command:
```console
TEST_CASE=TestFaultInjection make test
```


See the `*_test.go` source files to find the test case names.


### Running against a single ServiceMeshControlPlane version

By default, `make test` runs test cases against all supported versions of `ServiceMeshControlPlane`. When you want to run against a single `ServiceMeshControlPlane` version, specify the version in the `SMCP_VERSION` environment variable.

For example, to run the tests against version `v2.4`, run them as follows:
```console
SMCP_VERSION=2.4 make test
```

NOTE: you may include or omit the `v` prefix in the version number. 


### Running on architectures other than x86

By default, the tests assume that the cluster nodes use the x86 architecture. If your cluster uses a different architecture, set the `OCP_ARCH` environment variable before running the tests.

For IBM Power Systems, run tests with: 
```
OCP_ARCH=p make test
```

For IBM zSystems, run tests with:
```
OCP_ARCH=z make test
```

For ARM-based clusters, run tests with: 
```
OCP_ARCH=arm make test
```


### Running on Red Hat Openshift Service on AWS (ROSA)

To run tests on Red Hat Openshift Service on AWS (ROSA), set the `ROSA` environment variable to `true`:

```console
ROSA=true make test
```

### Disable must-gather for failed tests cases

To disable must-gather run after each test case failure in the test run, set the `MUST_GATHER` environment variable to `false`. Take into count that if the variable does not exist by default it is set to `true`:

```console
MUST_GATHER=false make test
```

### Running multi-cluster test cases

The test suite contains both single- and multi-cluster test cases. 
By default, only single-cluster test cases are run. 
To run multi-cluster tests, ensure that the `KUBECONFIG2` environment variable points to the `kubeconfig` file for the second cluster. 


### Running tests in VSCode, GoLand, or another IDE

The tests in maistra-test-tool are standard go tests and can be run in an IDE using standard methods. No special setup is required.

#### VSCode tweaks

To show/run/debug code in VSCode, you need to install the GO extension.

##### Running test

If you want to run some test case directly from VSCode (via the Testing panel or from source code tooltips), you need to pass required ENVs and flags and increase the default test timeout. Add(update) the following settings into settings.json (`CTRL+SHIFT+P` > `Open User Settings (JSON)`)
```
    "go.testEnvFile": "${workspaceFolder}/test.env",
    "go.testTimeout": "30m",
    "go.testFlags": [
        "-v"
    ]
```
After that, create `test.env` file in the test suite root and add all required/desired environment variables, e.g.
```
SMCP_VERSION=2.4
MUST_GATHER=false
```

##### Debugging test

The test can be also debugged (via the Testing panel or from source code tooltips) with the setting above however, the debug console doesn't show the same output in the debug console as during the running phase in output. You can use the following custom launch.json (Add it to the .vscode folder or update the existing one)
```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Debug test case",
            "type": "go",
            "request": "launch",
            "mode": "auto",
            "program": "${fileDirname}",
            "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/test.env",
            "args": [
                "-test.v",
                "-test.run",
                "${selectedText}"
            ],
        }
    ]
}
```
After that, you can easily debug the test case by highlighting the name of the test method and pressing F5 (If you have that `Debug test case` config selected in the Run and Debug panel).

### Reducing log output

Due to the eventually-consistent nature of OpenShift clusters, each test performs a series of retry attempts of each action it performs. 
By default, each attempt is logged, which typically results in a series of transient failures being shown in the log. 
You can prevent maistra-test-tool from logging each attempt by setting the `LOG_FAILED_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` environment variable to `false`.
The verbose output is mostly useful while writing or debugging tests. In CI systems, using the less-verbose form might be preffered.

To disable verbose logging, run the tests as follows:
```console
LOG_FAILED_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=false make test
```

### Running tests in a container

You can also run the test suite in a container, using the image `quay.io/maistra/maistra-test-tool:latest`. 
In addition to the environment variables explained above, you must also set the following environment variables:
- `OCP_API_URL` - The URL of the OpenShift API server.
- `OCP_TOKEN` - The authentication token for OpenShift. Alternatively, you can set the username and password via the `OCP_CRED_USR` and `OCP_CRED_PSW` environment variables.
- `OCP_CRED_USR` - The username to use when logging into OpenShift.
- `OCP_CRED_PSW` - The login password.


For example, to run all the tests against your local CodeReady Containers cluster, run the following command:
```console
podman run -it \
  --add-host api.crc.testing:$(crc ip) \
  -e OCP_API_URL=https://api.crc.testing:6443 \
  -e OCP_TOKEN=<token> \ 
  quay.io/maistra/maistra-test-tool:latest
```

Use the `-e` option to set the environment variables that affect the execution of the test suite, as described in the previous sections. 

## Test Results

Each time you run `make test`, a new directory named `result-<timestamp>` containing the results of the test run is created under `tests/`. 
Additionally, a symbolic link named `result-latest` is updated to point to the latest result directory every time you run `make test`.

The result directory might look as the following example:

```console
tests/
└── result-20230203040506/          The root result directory for a particular test run.
    ├── v2.2/                       Contains the results against the v2.3 version of the ServiceMeshControlPlane.
    │   ├── failures-must-gather/   Contains must-gather snapshots of cluster resources for each failed test.
    │   │   └── 123-TestSomething   Must-gather captured when the TestSomething failed.
    │   ├── failed.log              Output of the failed test cases.
    │   ├── output.log              Output of all test cases executed for this ServiceMeshControlPlane version.
    │   ├── report.xml              JUnit XML report for this ServiceMeshControlPlane version.
    │   ├── reruns.txt              List of test cases that failed and were executed multiple times.
    │   └── skipped.log             List of skipped test cases and corresponding reasons.
    │   └── documentation.txt       List of all the test cases and subtest cases executed in the test run and his steps.
    ├── ...
    └── output.log                  The full test log across all SMCP versions.
```
